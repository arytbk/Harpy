{"name":"Harpy","tagline":"Notify users that a new version of your iOS app is available, and prompt them with the AppStore link","body":"## About\r\n**Harpy** is a utility that checks a user's currently installed version of your iOS application against the version that is currently available in the AppStore. If a new version is available, an instance of UIAlertView is presented to the user informing them of the newer version, and giving them the option to update the application.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n- The **left picture** forces the user to update the app.\r\n- The **center picture** gives the user the option to update the app.\r\n- The **right picture** gives the user the skip the current update.\r\n- This option is configurable in **HarpyConstants.h**.\r\n \r\n![Forced Update](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/blob/master/picForcedUpdate.png?raw=true \"Forced Update\") \r\n![Optional Update](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/blob/master/picOptionalUpdate.png?raw=true \"Optional Update\")\r\n![Skipped Update](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/blob/master/picSkippedUpdate.png?raw=true \"Optional Update\")\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Copy the 'Harpy' folder into your Xcode project.\r\n\r\n1. Import **Harpy.h** into your AppDelegate or Pre-Compiler Header (.pch)\r\n\t\t\r\n1. Configure the static variables in **HarpyConstants.h**, and remove the ```#warning``` after customizing said variables. \r\n\r\n\t- Note: `kHarpyAlertType` is set to `AlertType_Option` by default. \r\n\t- To force the user to update your app on launch, set `kHarpyAlertType` to `AlertType_Force`\r\n\t- To allow the user to forego seeing alerts for current AppStore version, set `kHarpyAlertType` to `AlertType_Skip`\r\n\t- To have an alert pop up each time the application launches from a full shutdown (e.g., no background), keep the default setting (`KHarpyAlertType == AlertType_Option`).  \r\n\r\n1.  In your **AppDelegate.m**, add **only one** of the following methods:\r\n\t- `[Harpy checkVersion]` after makeKeyAndVisible is called on your UIWindow iVar in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`\r\n\t- `[Harpy checkVersionDaily]` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`\r\n\t- `[Harpy checkVersionWeekly]` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`\r\n\t- **NOTE: Call only one of the Harpy methods, as they all perform a check on your application's first launch. Using multiple methods will result in multiple UIAlertViews to pop.**\r\n\t\r\n<pre>\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\r\n{\r\n\r\n\t// Present Window before calling Harpy\r\n\t[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]\r\n\t\r\n\t// Perform check for new version of your app \r\n\t[Harpy checkVersion] \r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application\r\n{\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t Perform daily check for new version of your app\r\n\t Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time\r\n \t Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n \t \r\n \t Also, performs version check on first launch.\r\n \t*/\r\n\t[Harpy checkVersionDaily];\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t Perform weekly check for new version of your app\r\n\t Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time\r\n\t Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:\r\n\t \r\n\t Also, performs version check on first launch.\r\n\t */\r\n\t[Harpy checkVersionWeekly];\r\n    \r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd you're all set!\r\n\r\n## Important Note on AppStore Submissions\r\n- The AppStore reviewer will **not** see the alert. \r\n\r\n##  Release Notes (v2.2.0):\r\n- Added third option that allows users to skip seeing alerts for current AppStore version\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n- [Aaron Brager](http://www.github.com/getaaron) in v1.5.0\r\n- [Claas Lange](https://github.com/claaslange) in v2.0.0\r\n- [Josh T.
